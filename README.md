# Trash
Like a collection of my crappy codes (?)

`trash` is basically 2019's `shit` which contains the scripts I wrote between 2017-10 and the end of 2018.

## Done(?)
- `[Carroll's MischMasch.html](https://dreamski21.github.io/trash/2019-01/mischmasch.html)` (2019-01)
- `[EDT++.html](https://dreamski21.github.io/trash/2019-02/edt++.html)` (2019-02)

## TODO
- A minimalist AAN "AI" that plays a text-based, Flappy-Bird-like game.
