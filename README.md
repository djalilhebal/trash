# Trash
Like a collection of my crappy codes (?)

`trash` is basically 2019's `shit` (My `shit` repo contains the scripts I wrote between 2017-10 and the end of 2018.)

## Done
- `Carroll's MischMasch.html` (2019-01)

## TODO
- A minimalist AAN "AI" that plays a text-based, Flappy-Bird-like game.

## License
WTFPL
