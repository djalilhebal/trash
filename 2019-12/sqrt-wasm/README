Re-writing my old sqrt function in AssemblyScript

Why?
=====
Having learned a bit of assembly language (MASM) in my second year's Computer Architecture course,
and out of curiosity, I wanted to check WASM and do something with it.
... And maybe to prove a point to some students that the shit we're studying is actually important.

Files
======
- `sqrt.ts` is basically the same as `sqrt.js` but with comments and explicit types
- `sqrt.as.ts` is `sqrt.ts` ported to AssemblyScript
- `sqrt.untouched.excerpt.wat` is my non-optimized compiled code in the WebAssembly text format
- `sqrt.optimized.excerpt.wat` is my optimized compiled code in the WebAssembly text format
